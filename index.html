    <h1><code>EventPort</code> Javascript implementation.</h1>
    <desc>
    This project is a basic js implementation of an EventPort API loosely based on 
    <a href="https://github.com/WICG/input-for-workers/pull/8">https://github.com/WICG/input-for-workers/pull/8</a><br>
    This is only a testing project meant to better see how such an API should be shaped.<br>
    Do not use in production, as it hasn't been tested, and probably won't be.<br>
    <br>
    Currently doesn't work between cross-origin documents.
